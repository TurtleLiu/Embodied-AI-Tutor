## 🎯 Activity Case: From Commutators to Conjugates

**Goal:** Verify non-commutativity and explore cycle decomposition.

**Setup:** Start from a solved state ($e$).

### 1. **Proving Non-Commutativity**
Perform $R F'$ followed by $F' R$.

$$R F' \neq F' R$$

*Prompt:* Identify the pieces that moved differently. Why does order matter?

### 2. **The Commutator $C$**
Execute the sequence $C = R F' R' F$ ("Out, Out, In, In").

*Observation:* Notice that most of the cube remains fixed, but specific corners and edges are swapped.

### 3. **Order of an Element**
Repeat the sequence $C$ six times: $C^6$.

$$(R F' R' F)^6 = e$$

*Prompt:* Why did it take 6 cycles to return to identity? (Hint: Look at the 3-cycle of edges and 2-cycle of corners).

### 4. **Conjugation (Setup Moves)**
Apply a setup move $U$, perform the commutator $C$, then undo the setup $U'$.

$$g = U (R F' R' F) U'$$

*Result:* The permutation effect of $C$ is transported to a new location on the Upper face.

## 📚 Academic Context

This tutor implements the framework from:

**Luo, T., et al. (2026).** *An Embodied AI Tutor that Turns Rubik’s Cube Interaction into Learnable Group Structure. Nature Science of Learning.*

### Key Research Contributions:
1. **Embodied Learning Design**: Transforms concrete cube operations into abstract algebraic concepts
2. **Distributed Inquiry Cycle**: Creates a teacher-student-agent triad for collaborative learning
3. **Reversible Micro-Experiments**: Enables exploration through pause, step, rewind, and replay
4. **Cognitive Load Management**: Makes comparisons visible and repeatable to reduce learning barriers
5. **Symbolic Readouts**: Exposes operational tests for group properties (identity, inverses, commutativity)

### Abstract
How do abstract algebraic ideas emerge from concrete action, and what role can educational agents play in that process? We introduce an **embodied AI Rubik’s Cube tutor** that reframes group theory learning as an inquiry cycle distributed across a teacher–student–agent triad. Rather than presenting definitions first, the agent orchestrates short, reversible micro-experiments on a physical cube—pause, step, rewind, replay, and slow-motion—that invite learners to predict outcomes, test hypotheses, and explain contrasts. This design targets core cognitive hurdles of early group reasoning (objectifying operations, definition checking, and translating between embodied and symbolic representations), while managing cognitive load by making comparisons visible and repeatable.

Technically, the tutor learns from action–consequence data. From tuples $(o_t,a_t,o_{t+1})$, it trains a compact transition model and exposes **symbolic readouts**—operational tests for identity/inverses, composition equivalence, and commuting vs. non-commuting move pairs. These readouts drive formative prompts and misconception-focused contrasts, positioning the agent as an experiment generator and classroom assistant rather than a black-box solver.
